# OSCP-Notes
My notes were recorded using Cherry Tree. My notes are in the OSCP.ctd file. Here is the link to their website where you can download their software to view my notes: https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/.
In addition, I have added some useful tools for tackling the PEN-200 lab machines.
